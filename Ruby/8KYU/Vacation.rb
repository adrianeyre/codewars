After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation.
So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the
mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation.
The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days,
you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more
days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

# My Solution
def rental_car_cost(d)
  total = d * 40
  return total -= 50 if d > 6
  d > 2 ? (return total -= 20) : total
end
