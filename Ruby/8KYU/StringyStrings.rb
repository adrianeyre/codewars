=begin

write me a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating '1s' and '0s'.

the string should start with a 1.

a string with size 6 should return :'101010'.

with size 4 should return : '1010'.

with size 12 should return : '101010101010'.

The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.

=end

# My Solution
def stringy(size)
  (1..size).map {|x| x % 2}.join
end
