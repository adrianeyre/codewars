=begin

Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user.
However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him
slightly different. She added a special case to her function,
but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

=end

def greet(name)
  return ( name == "Johnny" ) ? "Hello, my love!" : "Hello, #{name}!"
end
