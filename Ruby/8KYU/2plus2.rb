Steve loves MS Windows calculator in Standard mode.

He tries to calculate 2 + 2 * 2 in his favorite programming language.
But Steve doesn't know about order of operations and he wonders why answers
are different. He expects 8 but gets 6.

Help Steve to fix program, so result will be identical to MS Windows calculator.
