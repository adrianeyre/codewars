=begin

Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells
it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply
to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the
lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

Task

Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of
the given list/array.

Examples

min_max([1,2,3,4,5])   == [1,5]
min_max([2334454,5])   == [5, 2334454]
min_max([1])           == [1, 1]
Remarks

All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't
need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or
a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

# My Solution
def min_max(lst)
  lst.sort!
  return [lst.first,lst.last] # fix me
end

# Better Solution
def min_max(lst)
  lst.minmax
end

# Another Solution
def min_max(lst)
  return [lst.min, lst.max]
end
